# WooCommerce Orphaned Variations Viewer
Display and manage orphaned product variations in WooCommerce

Please use the built-in orphan variation tool to delete orphan variations: **WP Admin > WooCommerce > Status > Tools**

This is a proof of concept / test plugin created by claude.ai that should NOT be used in a production environment.

The purpose of this plugin is to review the list of orphaned variations before deleting using the WooCommerce tool.
